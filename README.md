# project1-jeopardy

## Overview:

For Project 1, I created a Jeopardy game that involves catagories about **history,music,films,video games, and even a random catagory** option. There will be many options to choose from to gain points. there are five catagories and five rows of questions starting from $100 to $500 points.

**Live Site:** [Jeopardy Game in Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)

## Technolgies Used:

1. **Languages** - _Html5,CSS3, Javascript_
2. **Design** - _SweetAlert_, _BootStrap_
3. **Project Planning and User Stories** - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/nZjs7kGY/project-1)
4. **Visual Studio Code**

## Wireframe:

**You can find my wireframe for the game in** [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/PlxJoSMyUQY52f9L5y4I4vVf/Project-1?node-id=0%3A1)

## Future Development:

1. Add an AI like (player vs. computer)
2. Make it to where you can change the themes of the jeopardy board and catagories.x
3. Find a way to dry up my code by maybe using an object and constructor to make questions and answers. And then create button element for me to append my objects into the buttons.
